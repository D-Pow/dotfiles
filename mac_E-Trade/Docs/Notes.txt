Self-description
Devon began his E*TRADE adventure as a member of the 2018 analyst team. After graduating with a master's degree in computer science from NYU Tandon, he joined E*TRADE as a full-stack developer in the technology department. Now, he spends his days improving E*TRADE's systems and his nights playing guitar, exploring happy hours around the city, and spending too much money on food.

Health plan differences
High deductible
1500 - 500 (etrade cont) = 1000 deductible (almost always used)

One possibility
Pres: 100*12 months     = 1200
Spec: 135               =  135
Psych: 100*2 months + 100*0.2*10  =  400 (- 0.8*$65 for passing the deductible half-way through) = 352
E-Trade contribution   =  -500

Total 1187


Another possibility
Pres: 40 * 12 months   =  360
Spec: 135              =  135
Psych: 100*10 mnths + 100*0.2*2 mnths =  1040
E-trade contrib        =  -500

Total 1035


Average
Pres: 100*12m  = 1200
Spec:          =  135
Psych: 100*12m = 1200
2535 total - (2535-1500 = 1035*0.8 (above ded) = 828) - 500 E-Trade = 1207
or pres: 40*12 = 480
1815 total - (1815-1500 = 315*0.8 (above ded) = 252) - 500 E-Trade = 1063

Total (average) 1135


POS II
550 deductible (but only touched if I am an inpatient somewhere)
Cost: more yearly = 600
Pres: 10*12 = 120
Spec: $40 copay
Psych: 25 copay * 12 months = 300

Total 1060

This is still cheaper than high deductible plan, however, things like
hospitals are 250 more than high-ded-plan ($250 copay and only 80% coverage).
However, the entire hospital bill would be on me until the deductible is paid, so
a high hospital bill would easily be better under the POS plan than the high-ded-plan

E*TRADE Fall 2018 Hackathon Description
Jersey City
Offline Progressive Web App
Immad Mohamed, Brian Scott, Devon Powell

Our project this hackathon was to make a progressive web app (PWA).
A PWA stores the most recent versions of a website's resources so that
it both loads substantially faster and so that it functions even
without an internet connection. This creates an overall smoother
experience when using E*TRADE's websites. We implemented a simple
example of this functionality using JavaScript Service Workers.

Comments/recommendations on our technologies
1) I wish we were offered PC laptops (not Macbooks) that had Linux installed because it would be way easier than both Windows and Mac for development.

2) I wish we had licenses for applications including WebStorm and Sublime Text.

3) I am grateful for the two monitors supplied to me and the ability to get hardware from the store that I need (keyboard, mouse, headset, etc.) but I think the headset offered is a low quality and difficult to hear other users. It would be better to offer Airpods instead.

4) As quick and easy as the Self Service (installation program) is, it makes things really difficult to customize (including updating) the software installed. I think it'd be better to use brew for those with Macs.

5) The proxy is a real pain to deal with. cntlm helps a lot, but I still run into random issues when using certain technologies (e.g. npm, end-to-end testing, SauceLabs, etc.). It'd help to allow an exception without having to get the advanced permissions for accessing the web.

6) Cisco AnyConnect remote login sometimes slows down after being connected for over 5 hours. I have to disconnect and reconnect for it to go back to normal.

7) I appreciate the Pluralsight, semlr, safaribooks, O'Reilly, Coursera, and LinkedIn Learning subscriptions.

8) I've never been able to print using the printers but I'm not sure why. I can see the document in the queue, but nothing happens when clicking it.

9) It'd be nice to have a development server somewhere for use for things like the hackathon and in the middle of developing Slack apps where users can have elevated permissions at least for all required functions, e.g. starting a server.

etcommands for EM (usually uses etserver)

Environment:Application:Server:Instance:Node:Configuration

In that config json file, the 'instances' fields hold ASI's (app:server:instance)

etcmd -s vim ___

Things to change to match your own directory
_bin/premarket/premarket.py
_js/cfg.js
index.html -> js and css files instead of hotfix make it DEVON

deepak and shivam will help with my tickets

for premarket.py job names and stuff, 'prd' is already set in the config (as environment, env)
so they only keep the application (right after environment) and job name (right after application).
Note that they don't keep the machine or anything else.

/home/etdash/nagiosplug
/opt/nagios/nrpe/nagiosplug
/etrade/pkgs/linux/intel/nagiosplug
/etrade/home/etdash/nagiosplug

Pre-requisites:
LDAP account is g2g
You have a soft token for VIP Access.
 
If you don’t have either of the two above, you’ll need to put in a ticket to get it.
 
Once you have both, you should be able to:
 
~In PuTTY (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) or whatever your favorite flavor of SSH client is, simply ssh to dash1w100m3.
~ssh dash1w100m3
~For this machine, we have two factor authentication enabled. If you are successfully able to connect to the machine, you will eventually see “Password+SecurityCode:”. Here you’ll put in your LDAP password and the six-digit code in your VIP Access soft token. Once authenticated, your skeleton profile should route you right into the etenv script which will take you through a series of prompts to ask you which application context you’d like to go into. For dash1w100m3, I usually just use EASI prd:etdash:batch:dash. (this is because there are packages associated with that instance that I use). The default directory you will be dropped into is $ET_INSTANCE_ROOT - for that instance: /etrade/<e>/<a>/<s>/<i>.
~Your staging directory will be /dashboard/html/premarket_<your_FN> as I created yesterday. This is where you’ll deploy your branches/staging code.
~Once you’ve reached this step, we’ll move on to deploying your branch/staging area….
    ~Checkout the ETDash GIT repository
    ~Create a tarball of the premarket subdirectory
    ~SCP the file to the dash1w100m3 server
    ~Untar that tarball into your staging directory – “dashboard/html/premarket_<your_FN> as I created yesterday”
 
If you run into any problems getting to this step - or have any questions, let me know.
