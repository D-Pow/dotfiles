# [Karabiner Mac Key Mapper](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

The best option out there for re-mapping keyboard/mouse buttons to custom functions.

* **Don't map keys in System Preferences**, only use Karabiner since it takes care of e.g. Ctrl --> Command remapping itself.
* Simply copy this folder to the `~/.config/` directory after installing Karabiner.

# Special Keyboard Keys

Use [USB Overdrive](https://www.usboverdrive.com/) to find/map special keys not found by Karabiner.

Note: USB Overdrive can't find Web Home/Forward/Back on Mac OS Big Sur (11.4).
