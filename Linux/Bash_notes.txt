OPTIND is var holding the next argument during each iteration of getopts
In the last iteration, OPTIND holds the value that is not an option
Use `shift "$((OPTIND - 1))" to shift arg so that you don't have options anymore
Put that operation in quotes to keep it safe

$((...)) is mathematical procedure

!= is for strings

-ne is for numbers

Functions must be declared before use

Pass vars to functions like so: func $var1 $var2

$@ is the sign for "rest of the arguments as one string"

Similar string splicing as Python
${$var:(start):(end)}
e.g. To only get last n letters from string, do     `${$var:(-n)}`
To get all letters except last n, do        `       `${$var::(-n)}`
