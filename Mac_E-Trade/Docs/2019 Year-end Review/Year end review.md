# To improve

* Things that aren't hands-on
    * Tickets that primarily involve delegating tasks to other people (e.g. end-to-end Jenkins configurations)
    * Communication
        * Misunderstand what people say or be too frank when I tell others things (e.g. Oct. 1st, when making the suggestion for Deepika to re-check browsers for prebuilt mobile chart)
        * It's not uncommon for me to have to explain my thoughts multiple times when making a point in meetings because the first explanation wasn't clear enough
