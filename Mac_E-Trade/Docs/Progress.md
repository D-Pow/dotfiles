#    Summary/TL;DR    #
#######################

## Progress at E*TRADE ##
* Escalated from junior dev to more of a lead dev in every project I've worked on
    - Premarket dashboard: Went from intro junior dev -> teaching new hires about the system -> becoming the **lead architect** of the premarket dashboard
        + In the first sprint, I finished and pulled over **3x the number of stories** and committed them before any other new hire made one
        + Lead dev would always complement me and be surprised at my progress, then had to back-up to complement the rest of the team
        + I **added more improvements/features than anyone else on the team (including leads)** during my time working on the premarket dashboard
        + Conceptualized and planned a _**redesign of the whole app**_. Lead the improvement effort and left the app in a reasonable state for the next team to pick up
    - AIP: Continuously progressed from working menial tasks to becoming a lead
        + I have **improved the way we code** with support from the shared developer Slack channels
        + Contributed to a similar degree and higher quality than the lead dev
        + Practically completed the entire last sprint **completely alone**
* Solved a company-wide issue using a small library written in my free time
    - E-Trade had notorious issues with the network going down, both within roll periods (happened twice a week, lasted for most of the work day) and randomly throughout the week (often from problems outside the team's control, e.g. a server goes down, was poorly configured, or another team changed a config file without informing our team)
    - I solved this in my free time by writing a very small open-source library for mocking network requests in the front-end. This way, devs could continue their work even in the presence of such a wide array of network issues
    - Added to multiple apps currently in use, as well as a scaffolding app that will serve as the foundation of all new React apps within E-Trade
* Challenge and improve the way teams at E*TRADE code
    - I made multiple well-constructed points in the shared code channels, resulting in a deep consideration about how to write code and **improving our coding practices**
    - Completely revamped the way the premarket team worked. **Increased productivity of the whole team** by moving them from inefficient vim usage to IDE usage. Wrote a readme and scripts to make a **seamless transition** and easy usage so that they wouldn't have to do any configuration themselves

## Salary considerations ##
* Software engineering in financial services average salary: $126,000
    - Entry level: ~$100,000 - $115,000
        + Master's degree yeilds ~$10,000 more on average than bachelor's
        + $105,000 - $120,000
        + Below market by $15-30k
* My entry: $90,000
    - $10,000 sign-on bonus (bringing base pay acceptably close to market level for the first year)
    - Average 6-7 hours of overtime per pay period, paid at $64.905 -> $10,125 - 11,813 annually
* Proposition
    - Base (90k) + overtime (10-12k) + merit raise (6-10% fintech avg) = $106,133 - $111,994

#      Specifics      #
#######################

#######################
#    Prebuilt/AIP     #
#######################
* Played a key role in reducing technical debt, constantly refactoring the app to be more reusable and easier to understand
* Researched, set up, and deployed the first end-to-end testing framework, and introduced it to our team
* Made multiple contributions to other apps within E-Trade, including our design-language (repo with common tools/components for use throught the company), scaffolding app, and other investing products

#######################
#   AIP Performance   #
#######################
* In the first month, number of new accounts went from 9 to 490 -> 5,400% increase
* Increase in number of automatic investing plans made per day by 500%
* 15% growth in number of automatic investing customers
* 37% growth in mutual fund purchases
* Growth of 5% in new accounts and 6% in new plans total for entire company
* Estimated annual increase in revenue of $7 million

#########################
## Efficient/Inventive ##
#########################
* I **headed the architecture redesign** of the premarket dashboard. It was
  very disorganized, there was no structured flow of data, and it was very
  difficult to understand what was happening and where/why. I was the sole
  person who conceptualized and designed a reorganized code structure. I then
  led the application and refactoring of my design decisions to result in a
  much better product that would be easy to understand when handed off to
  another team.
* I improved the organization of etdash by examining commonalities in code
  and extracting them to flexible utility functions. Shivam even exclaimed how
  this will **save a lot of effort** by the devs and remove a lot of repeated
  code/make future work much easier
* Instead of following the premarket team's footsteps and using vim to work on
  remote files, I **created a more efficient way to work on remote files locally** so that
  I could use an IDE/text editor
    - I broke this down into a step-by-step readme/series of scripts to
      **increase productivity** of the rest of the team
* In my first sprint with premarket dashboard, I pulled over multiple extra user
  stories because I finished the first ones so quickly
    - I made PRs on all of these before the other new hires made 1
    - This trend continued throughout the project timespan
    - I felt a little guilty because Geoff kept complementing me and then
      would backtrack a bit and complement the rest of the team
* During the time I worked on the premarket dashboard, I **added more features and improvements** than anyone else on the team
* I'll work on extra tickets whenever my work is running low in order to keep
  my time use and contributions at a maximum
* Over time with AIP, I've escalated to become more of a lead developer instead of a junior; I challenged and **succeeded in changing the way we code**, improved old traditions, and practically completed an entire sprint completely alone (7 of 8 stores of the final December 2018 sprint, the last one being a problem story for Paul)
* Similarly, I've started many discussions in the coding/appdev/development channels, many of which resulted in **improving our coding style**


###################
## Quick learner ##
###################
* Learned the premarket dashboard quickly enough to **teach it to the other new hires**
* Learned React
    - I learned enough to make informed decisions about component design
    - I successfully contributed to the design language
    - I continue to work with design language PRs
* Became quite well versed in regex and JavaScript specifics after never
  having used them previously


##########################
## Good time management ##
##########################
* Added new design language component while waiting for DVL access
* Worked with MAS team when work with premarket dashboard was slow


#########################
## Helpful/Team player ##
#########################
* I share my knowledge of the systems/technologies I learn with the
  people around me in a detailed manner so that they can understand as
  well as possible
    - Creating the **readme/scripts** for working on remote files locally
    - Posting **step-by-step instructions** on the intricacies of installing
      and using cntlm on the security and tips-and-tricks channels
    - Teaching Bilal and Meghan about how etdash works
    - Teaching Joliana about surge queues/web servers
    - Alexis with the slackbot
    - Posting scripts/instructions in the tips-and-tricks channel
* I've made friends both with the rest of my team and with other workers in my location
    - I've organized different after-work activities and inspired others to
      attend
    - I've made events out of times when I know people are in town for a
      period of time and don't have anything to do during that time
