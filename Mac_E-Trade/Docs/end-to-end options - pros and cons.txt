X-ray is used for updating Jira tickets with test plans and execution pass/fail status
    Example: STRUM-7046

Report portal - shows stats of tests

Alternatives to Nightwatch
    TestCafe
        Couldn't aggregate selections, e.g. counting how many elements of a selector exists on the page
    Cypress
        Only supports Chrome
        Has a fantastic network-mocking system that intercepts requests and returns desired mock objects
    Webdriver.io
        Uses standard jest syntax, so no new flows to learn
        Doesn't have a wrapper around selenium, so devs can run selenium commands directly
    Note: Alternatives won't be able to use common commands in e-watch (e.g. logging in, x-ray integration)

There's already a Java testing framework that has support for cross-browser testing
    It's in a separate repo and would thus need to stay separate from the current front-end rep
    Devs need approval by QA to get access to this repo
    Takes videos/images of tests & says where they failed

Tips when writing code
    If you add a special attribute (e.g. `<div data-test="myComponent" />`), it makes finding your element much easier because you can access it directly without needing to worry about nested CSS selectors or the page layout changing later
