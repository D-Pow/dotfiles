$((...)) is mathematical procedure

!= is for strings

-ne is for numbers

Functions must be declared before use

Pass vars to functions like so: func $var1 $var2

$@ is the sign for "rest of the arguments as one string"
    To respect quotes in args (e.g. arg1 is "my file.txt"), wrap "$@" in double quotes

$(command) == `command`

Similar string splicing as Python
${$var:(start):(end)}
e.g. To only get last n letters from string, do     `${$var:(-n)}`
To get all letters except last n, do        `       `${$var::(-n)}`
