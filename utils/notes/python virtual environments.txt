This sets up a virtual environment for python on the system
such that the installed dependencies are only used locally.
Note that in this case the virtual environment name is
"dependencies" but it could be named whatever you want.


# In terminal:
python3 -m venv dependencies
source dependencies/bin/activate  # or on Windows:  dependencies/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# do python stuff

# when done, run:
deactivate
