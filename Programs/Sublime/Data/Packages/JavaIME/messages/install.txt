Welcome to Java Import Made Easy (JavaIME)
===========================================

About
======

  This Sublime text package makes it easy to import virtually all Java packages, gives method completion suggestions for java methods, easily instantiate objects and create action listener methods.


How to Use
==========

You can use a lot of JavaIME features in the following ways.

  Methods
  =======
    Normal methods would pop up suggestions as you type.

    Static methods can be used by pressing 

    **S-** followed by method name. e.g.
      Type **S-AR**  then TAB to get

        ARGV


  Import
  ======
     _______________________________________________________________
    | Note you can also press ENTER rather than TAB for completion |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------

    To import the java.utils.Collections package, type COLLECTIONS in (uppercase). 
    Suggestions should already be popping up then press TAB to select. 
    The package will be automatically imported.

  Auto-Complete listener interfaces
  =================================

    To show a listener interface completion, type L- followed by the listener interface name. e.g.

    L-Focus TAB should show

        FocusListener

  Class Instance
  ==============

    Type I-class name e.g. I-Scanner should show

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

  Listener Events
  ===============

    Type E- followed by event and press tab. e.g.
    E-act then press TAB should show

        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
         // contents 
        }

  Try-Catch
  =========

  You can also press try then TAB after typing try to get
     
      try {

      }

      catch (Exception err) {
          System.out.println(err.getMessage());
      }
