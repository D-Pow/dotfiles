Not supposed to have to download/build s2common first

IntelliJ run configurations:
    Build ->
        working dir = project dir
        command line = clean install
    Run
        working dir = projectDir/webapp
        command line = jetty:run
        Runner -> Environment vars -> ET_INSTANCE_ROOT=/Users/dpowell1/repositories/mutual_fund_etf
